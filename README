Simple DataObjects
==================

A simple front-end for the lovely DataObjects adapters. For when you need to
bang on a database, but can't be bothered with an ORM.

    db = DataObjects::Simple.new("config/database.yml")
    db.select(
      "SELECT user_id, name FROM users WHERE created_at > ?",
      [Integer, String],
      Time.mktime(2007, 1, 1)
    ) #=> [[1, "Alice"], [2, "Bob"] ... ]
